📊 Task-01: Data Visualization using Bar Chart & Histogram
📌 Objective

The objective of this task is to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using appropriate graphical techniques such as bar charts and histograms.
These visualizations help in understanding population characteristics like gender distribution and age distribution in a dataset.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this task is taken from the official Prodigy InfoTech repository:

🔗 Sample Dataset:
https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%201

The dataset contains population-related information that allows analysis of variables such as:

Country

Gender (Male / Female)

Age groups

Population counts

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used to perform data analysis and visualization:

Python

Pandas – for data loading and manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib – for basic plotting

Seaborn – for enhanced visualization aesthetics

📈 Visualizations Performed
1️⃣ Bar Chart

Used to visualize categorical data

Example: Distribution of population by gender or top countries

Helps compare values across different categories

2️⃣ Histogram

Used to visualize continuous data

Example: Distribution of ages

Helps understand data spread, frequency, and skewness

📑 Steps Followed

Imported required Python libraries

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Cleaned and prepared the data

Selected relevant variables for visualization

Created bar charts and histograms

Added titles, labels, and legends for clarity

✅ Results & Insights

Bar charts clearly show comparisons between categorical variables

Histograms reveal the distribution pattern of continuous data

Visual analysis makes it easier to identify trends and population characteristics

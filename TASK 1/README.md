📊 Task 01 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Task Description
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

📂 Dataset
Dataset Name: World Population Dataset
Time Period Covered: 2001 – 2022
Source:
https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%201
🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
NumPy – numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Data Cleaning
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately
Removed duplicate records
Inspected the dataset for inconsistencies and outliers
2. Data Visualization
Created bar charts to visualize categorical distributions
Created histograms to understand continuous data distribution
Used stacked charts for comparative population analysis across years
📈 Conclusion
The EDA process helped in understanding population distribution patterns clearly through visual representation.
These insights form a solid base for further analysis and predictive modeling in the data science workflow.
